## Solving Nash equilibrium problems in binary strategies

We propose a novel method to find Nash equilibria in games with binary decision variables
by including compensation payments and incentive-compatibility constraints
from non-cooperative game theory directly into an optimization framework
in lieu of using first order conditions of a linearization, or relaxation of integrality conditions. 
The reformulation offers a new approach to obtain and interpret dual variables to binary constraints
using the benefit or loss from deviation rather than marginal relaxations. 
The method endogenizes the trade-off between overall (societal) efficiency 
and compensation payments necessary to align incentives of individual players. 

The manuscript with the theoretical background of dual variables in integer programs 
and the mathematical explanation of our method was published
in the [European Journal of Operational Research](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2017.09.032) (see below).

This repository includes the GAMS codes for the numerical results for the electricity market example 
presented in Chapter 4 and the Appendix of the manuscript (including all data),
as well as an additional illustrative example of a natural gas investment and operation game.
