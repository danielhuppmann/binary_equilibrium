Nash equilibria in binary strategies
====================================

Abstract
--------
We propose a novel method to find Nash equilibria in games with binary decision variables 
by including compensation payments and incentive-compatibility constraints from non-cooperative game theory 
directly into an optimization framework in lieu of using first order conditions of a linearization, 
or relaxation of integrality conditions. 

The reformulation offers a new approach to obtain and interpret dual variables to binary constraints 
using the benefit or loss from deviation rather than marginal relaxations. 
The method endogenizes the trade-off between overall (societal) efficiency 
and compensation payments necessary to align incentives of individual players.

The manuscript with the theoretical background of dual variables in integer programs 
and the mathematical explanation of our method is published 
in the [European Journal of Operational Research](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2017.09.032).
