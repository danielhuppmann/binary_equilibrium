The reformulation offers a new approach to obtain and interpret dual variables to binary constraints using the benefit or loss from deviation rather than marginal relaxations. The method endogenizes the trade-off between overall (societal) efficiency and compensation payments necessary to align incentives of individual players. \r\n\r\nThe manuscript with the theoretical background of dual variables in integer programs and the mathematical explanation of our method can be downloaded at [DIW Berlin](http://diw.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=diw_01.c.502763.de), [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.05894) and [OptimizationOnline](http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_HTML/2015/04/4874.html).\r\n\r\nThis repository includes the GAMS codes for the numerical results for the electricity market example presented in Chapter 4 and the Appendix of the manuscript (including all data), as well as an additional illustrative example of a natural gas investment and operation game.\r\n\r\n### Keywords\r\nbinary Nash game, non-cooperative equilibrium, multi-objective optimisation, compensation, incentive compatibility, electricity market, power market, uplift payments\r\n\r\n### Journal of Economic Literature Classification [JEL Codes](https://www.aeaweb.org/econlit/jelCodes.php?view=jel)\r\nC72, C61, L13, L94\r\n\r\n### Mathematics Subject Classification [MSC](https://cran.r-project.org/web/classifications/MSC.html)\r\n90C11, 90C46, 91B26\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis method and the codes were developed by @danielhuppmann and @ssaul3h.\r\n\r\n### Bibliography info\r\nPlease cite as:\r\nDaniel Huppmann and Sauleh Siddiqui.\r\n\"An exact solution method for binary equilibrium problems with compensation and the power market uplift problem\",\r\nDIW Discussion Paper 1475, 2015.\r\n\r\n### License\r\nThis work is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
